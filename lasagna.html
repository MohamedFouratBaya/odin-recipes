        <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook ground beef, Italian sausage, onion, and garlic over medium heat until meat is browned. Drain excess fat.</li>

        <li>In a bowl, combine cottage cheese and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Layer 4 lasagna noodles over the sauce, then spread half of the cottage cheese mixture over the noodles.</li>
        <li>Add a layer of meat sauce and sprinkle with mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, ending with noodles topped with remaining meat sauce and mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes or until cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
        <li>Let it cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
